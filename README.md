# student_database_live
An app that displays the student's attendance, marks and other relevant information.
Teachers can add and change the data.
Added a feature to let students log in with their roll numbers instead of the customary email in firebase.
Achieved this by creating a database in firebase which stores the student's username with the email as it's value.
To log in. The student can use both their email and roll number, the app will check which one it is and log in accordingly.
